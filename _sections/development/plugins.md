### Eclipse plug-in

The Shadow Eclipse plugin is also written in Java.  To work on it, you'll need the [Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)](http://www.eclipse.org/pde/), which is included in the Eclipse SDK or can be installed through Eclipse.
			
The GitHub site for the Shadow Eclipse plug-in is below.

We're also hoping to make an IntelliJ plug-in for Shadow at some point.
