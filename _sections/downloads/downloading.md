The Shadow compiler is written in Java, so you must have [Java 8](http://java.com/download) or higher to use Shadow, no matter your operating system. The compiler distributed as a JAR file with directories containing the standard Shadow libraries, written in Shadow with a few LLVM and C source files for lower level functionality.

The Clang compiler and other LLVM tools are also required to compile Shadow code, but those installations are more OS-specific.
